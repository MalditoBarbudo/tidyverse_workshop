# tidyr, dplyr & purr: the tidyverse

background-image: url(resources/images/hadley.png)
background-position: right bottom

Created by Hadley Wickham, chief scientist of RStudio, and author of more than
30 R packages (`readr`, `ggplot2`, `plyr`, `devtools`, `roxygen2`, `rmarkdown`...)

--

The **tidyverse** is made up of those packages (and others), as a suite designed
to ease the data analysis in all its steps.

--

class: middle, left

# Before we start...

  - Neither `tidyr`, nor `dplyr` or `purrr` do anything that can't be done with
    base R code, apply family functions, for-loops or other packages.  
  
  - Designed to be more eficient (in time), easier to read and easier to use
    (it may requires some adaptation if used to base R code).  
  
  - Valid mostly for data.frames. For other formats (matrices, arrays) `plyr` can
    be used.

---

# *tidyverse*: tidy data

![](resources/images/tidy_data.png)

--

  - Data in **tidy** format eases the processing and analysis, particularly in
    vectorized lenguages as R can be.
    
---

# our data

  1. `plots [11858 x 15]`: all plots from the Third Spanish Forest Inventory
     (IFN3) in Catalonia
  
  2. `trees [111756 x 12]`: all trees with dbh > 7.5 cm measured in both
     IFN2 and IFN3
  
  3. `species [14778 x 15]`: number of trees per hectare in each plot, by
     species and size class
  
  4. `coordinates [11858 x 6]`: X and Y UTM coordinates of each plot.

---

# let's have a look at the data

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
load('data/data_workshop.Rdata')
options(width = 70)
```

```{r tibbles, }
trees
```

---

# let's have a look at the data

Tibbles, not usual data.frames:

  - class `tbl_df`
  
  - print only 10 rows by default
  
  - inform about variable types

---
class: inverse

# dplyr

---

# 5 main verbs of dplyr

  - `filter`: keep the rows that match a condition
  
  - `select`: keep columns by name
  
  - `arrange`: sort rows
  
  - `mutate`: transform existent variables or create new ones
  
  - `summarise`: do some summary statistics and reduce data

---

# common structure (for most of the tidyverse)

```r
verb(data, ...)
```

- first argument: data (as data.frame or tbl_df)
- the rest of arguments specify what to do with the data frame
- output is always another tbl_df
- unless we are assigning (`<-`), never modifies the original data frame

---

# Selecting rows (`filter`)

```{r, filter_ex}
filter(trees, Dist < 3)
```


---

# Selecting rows (`filter`)

```{r, filter_ex2}
filter(trees, Provincia == '25')
```

---

# Selecting rows (`filter`)

```{r, filter_ex3}
filter(trees, CD %in% c(45, 70))
```

# Selecting rows (`filter`)

## Exercise 1

Let's find those plots in IFN3n (`plots` data frame) that:

  1.1 Are located either in Barcelona (08) or Girona (17)
  
  1.2 Were measured **before** January 2001
  
  1.3 It took **more** than 2 hours to measure (7200s)


---

# Selecting columns (`select`)

```{r select_ex}
select(trees, DiamIf3)
```

---

# Selecting columns (`select`)

```{r select_ex2}
select(trees, -Codi)
```

---

# Selecting columns (`select`)

```{r select_ex3}
select(trees, Codi:Cla)
```

---

# Selecting columns (`select`)

## Special functions:

- `starts_with`
- `ends_with`
- `contains`
- `match`
- `num_range`
- `one_of`
- `everything`

---

# Selecting columns (`select`)

```{r select_ex4}
select(trees, starts_with('Diam'))
```

---

# Selecting columns (`select`)

## Exercise 2

Think if three or four ways to select the variables that define the start and finish date
of plot measuring

---

# Sorting rows (`arrange`)

```{r arrange_ex}
arrange(trees, Dist)
```


---

# Sorting rows (`arrange`)

```{r arrange_ex2}
arrange(trees, desc(Dist))
```

---

# Sorting rows (`arrange`)

## Exercise 3

  3.1 Sort plots by date and hour of measurement
  
  3.2 Which plots were started to be measured later in the day?
  
  3.3 Which plots took longer to be measured?

---

# Transforming and adding new variables (`mutate`)

```{r mutate_ex}
mutate(
  trees,
  Dist = Dist * 100
)
```


---

# Transforming and adding new variables (`mutate`)

```{r mutate_ex2}
mutate(
  trees,
  Alometria = DiamIf3 / HeiIf3,
  Alometria2 = Alometria * DiamIf2
)
```

---

# Transforming and adding new variables (`mutate`)

## Exercise 4

  4.1 Get growth (in cm) of each tree between IFN2 and IFN3

  4.2 Create two new variables with basal area per hectare of each tree, both for IFN2 and
      Ifn3. Which is the species of the fastest-growing tree in basal area?

$$
AB = \frac{\pi}{4} · Diam^{2} · N
$$
---

# Reducing variables (`summarise`)

```{r summarise_ex}
summarise(trees, mean_if3 = mean(DiamIf3))
```

---

# Reducing variables (`summarise`)

## Summary functions

  - `min(x)`, `max(x)`, `quantile(x, p)`
  - `mean(x)`, `median(x)`, 
  - `sd(x)`, `var(x)`, `IQR(x)`
  - `n()`, `n_distinct(x)`
  
  - `sum(x > 10)`, `mean(x > 10)`

---

# Reducing variables (`summarise`)

## Grouped summarise

```{r grouped_summ_ex}
by_province <- group_by(plots, Provincia)
summarise(
  by_province,
  mean_ph_ifn3 = mean(PhSuelo, na.rm = TRUE),
  max_ph_ifn3 = max(PhSuelo, na.rm = TRUE),
  min_ph_ifn3 = min(PhSuelo, na.rm = TRUE)
)
```

---

# Reducing variables (`summarise`)

## Exercise 5

Which statistics would you calculate to characterize diameter values in each plot?

---

# Data pipelines (`%>%`)

- Often, we want to use several verbs (filter, arrange, group_by, summarise...)

- Multipleoperations are difficult to read, or require to create multiple intermediate
  objects:

.pull-left[

```{r bad_left, eval = FALSE}
diam_especie <- filter(
  summarise(
    group_by(
      filter(
        trees, !is.na(DiamIf3)
      ),
      Codi, Especie
    ),
    diam = mean(DiamIf3),
    n = n()
  ),
  n > 5
)
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r bad_right, eval = FALSE}
no_na_trees <- filter(
  trees, !is.na(DiamIf3)
)
no_na_trees_grouped <- group_by(
  no_na_trees, Codi, Especie
)
summarised_no_na_trees <- summarise(
  no_na_trees_grouped,
  diam = mean(DiamIf3), n = n()
)
final_data <- filter(
  summarised_no_na_trees, n > 5
)
```

]

---

# Data pipelines (`%>%`)

  - Alternative (cleaner and easy to read): *pipe* operator (`%>%`) from `magrittr` package
  
  - The result of the left side is passed to the function in the right as first argument:
  
```r
f(x, y) ~ x %>% f(y)

f(x, y, z) ~ x %>% f(y, z)
```

  - In the tidyverse `%>%` makes each function to be applied to the data frame resulting
    from the previous step

```r
filter(df, color == 'blue') ~ df %>% filter(color == 'blue')

mutate(df, double = 2*value) ~ df %>% mutate(double = 2*value)
```

---

# Data pipelines (`%>%`)

.pull-left[

Nested functions

```{r bad_left_2, eval = FALSE}
diam_especie <- filter(
  summarise(
    group_by(
      filter(
        trees, !is.na(DiamIf3)
      ),
      Codi, Especie
    ),
    diam = mean(DiamIf3),
    n = n()
  ),
  n > 5
)
```

]

--

.pull-right[

Functions key

```{r ok_right, eval = FALSE}
diam_especie <- trees %>%
  filter(!is.na(DiamIf3)) %>%
  group_by(Codi, Especie) %>%
  summarise(
    diam = mean(DiamIf3),
    n = n()
  ) %>%
  filter(n > 5)
```

]

---

# Data pipelines (`%>%`)

## Exercise 6

Create pipelines to answer the following questions:

  6.1 Which plots have the fastest average growth rate?
  
  6.2 Which is the plot with the most species?
  
  6.3 Is there any relationship between both variables?


---

# Grouped `mutate`/`filter`

We will commonly use groups (`group_by`) when summarising variables:

```r
group_by(Especie) %>% summarise(mean = mean(Diam))
```

Sometimes, however, we may be interested in calculating new variables by group, but without
reducing the dimensions:

```r
group_by(Especie) %>% mutate(
  std_diam = Diam - mean(Diam)
)
```

---

# Grouped `mutate`/`filter`

## Exercise 7

  7.1 Identify those trees that grow most as comared to the average in that plot
  
  7.2 Identify those plots where a species grows much more than the average for the species

Extra (in case you get bored):  

  7.3 Select IFN plots with pure *Pinus nigra* stands (Especie =
      025). Note: we consider a forest to be monospecific when > 80% in BA corresponds to
      a single species
      

---

# Joining data (`*_join`)

## Mutating joins

  - `left_join(x, y)`: Add observations in y that also appears in x. Original observations
    (x) are not lost
  
  - `right_join(x, y)`: Add observations in x that also appears in y. Original observations
    (y) are not lost
  
  - `full_join(x, y)`: All observations, x and y
  
  - `inner_join(x, y)`: Only observastions present in x and y

---

# Joining data (`*_join`)

## Filtering joins

  - `semi_join(x, y)`: Keep observations in x that are present in y
  
  - `anti_join(x, y)`: Remove observations in x present in y

---

# Joining data (`*_join`)

## Exercise 8

Add X and Y coordinates that are included in the `coordinates` data frame to each plot in
the `plots` data frame

# tidyr

---

# tidy data

![](resources/images/tidy_data.png)

--

  - Data in **tidy** format eases the processing and analysis, particularly in
    vectorized lenguages as R can be.

---

# tidyr

Data is not always organized...

```{r tb, echo=FALSE}
tb <- as_tibble(read.csv("tb.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)) %>%
  magrittr::set_names(
    ., stringr::str_remove(names(.), 'new_sp_')
  ) %>%
  select(-new_sp)
tb
```

---

# tidyr

.center[
```{r tb2, echo=FALSE}
tb %>%
  gather(demo, n, -iso2, -year, na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  separate(demo, c("sex", "age_group"), 1) %>%
  arrange(iso2, year, sex)
```
]

---

# tidyr

## The verbs of tidyr

  - `gather`: Convert data from *wide* to *long* format (Columns to id-value pairs)
  - `spread`: Convert data from *long* to *wide* format (id-value pairs to columns)
  - `separate`: Convert one column in serveral
  - `unite`: Join several columns in one

---

# tidyr

# common structure (for most of the tidyverse)

```r
verb(data, ...)
```

- first argument: data (as data.frame or tbl_df)
- the rest of arguments specify what to do with the data frame
- output is always another tbl_df
- unless we are assigning (`<-`), never modifies the original data frame

---

# tidyr

## `gather`

```{r gather_ex}
n_parcelas <- tibble(
  Prov = c('Lleida', 'Girona', 'Barcelona', 'Tarragona'),
  IFN_2 = c(16, 78, 60, 34),
  IFN_3 = c(18, 79, 67, 36)
)

n_parcelas
```

---

# tidyr

## `gather`

```{r gather_ex2}
n_parcelas_tidy <- n_parcelas %>%
  gather(IFN, n, IFN_2, IFN_3)

n_parcelas_tidy
```

---

# tidyr

## `separate`

```{r gather_ex3}
n_parcelas_sep <- n_parcelas %>%
  gather(IFN, n, IFN_2, IFN_3) %>%
  separate(IFN, c('name', 'ifn_version'), sep = '_')

n_parcelas_sep
```

---

# `gather` and `separate`

## Exercise 9

Use `gather` and `separate` to transform the data frame species into a **tidy** format,
where each column is a variable and each row an observation

---

# tidyr

## `spread`

```{r spread_ex}
n_parcelas_tidy %>%
  spread(IFN, n)
```

---

# tidyr

## `unite`

```{r unite_ex}
n_parcelas_sep %>%
  unite(IFN, name, ifn_version, sep = '_')
```

---

# `spread` and `unite`

## Exercise 10

Use `unite` and `spread` to transform the data from exercise 9 into its original format

---
class: inverse

# purrr

---

# purrr

Allows to do functional programming with R, making loops and repetitive tasks
pipe-friendly and easier to read.

```{r purrr_ex}
c(1, 2, 3) %>%
  map_dbl(~ .*2)

c('a', 'b', 'c') %>%
  map_chr(~ paste0('treatment_', .))
```

Can be used as alternatives to `apply` family functions (`lapply`, `vapply`...)

---

# purrr

# common structure (for most of the tidyverse)

```r
verb(.x, .f, ...)
```

- first argument: vector or list (included data frames)
- second argument: function to apply to each element of .x
- output is always a vector or a list of the same length as .x

---

# purrr

## The verbs of tidyr

  - `map`: Tranforms the input by applying a function to each element and returning a
           vector the same length as the input
  - `walk`: The same as `map`, but only for the side-effect, returning the original input
  
---

# map

## Flavours

  - `map`: Returns always a list
  - `map_chr`, `map_dbl`, `map_int`, `map_lgl`: Returns a vector of the corresponding type
  - `map_dfr`, `map_fdc`: Returns a data frame created by row- or column-binding

You are recommended to use the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), but you do not have to.

- Create a new R Markdown document from the menu `File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> Ninja Presentation`;<sup>1</sup>

--

- Click the `Knit` button to compile it;

--

- or use the [RStudio Addin](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/)<sup>2</sup> "Infinite Moon Reader" to live preview the slides (every time you update and save the Rmd document, the slides will be automatically reloaded in RStudio Viewer.

# Hello Ninja

As a presentation ninja, you certainly should not be satisfied by the "Hello World" example. You need to understand more about two things:

1. The [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com) library;

1. The **xaringan** package;

Basically **xaringan** injected the chakra of R Markdown (minus Pandoc) into **remark.js**. The slides are rendered by remark.js in the web browser, and the Markdown source needed by remark.js is generated from R Markdown (**knitr**).

---

# remark.js

You can see an introduction of remark.js from [its homepage](https://remarkjs.com). You should read the [remark.js Wiki](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki) at least once to know how to

- create a new slide (Markdown syntax<sup>*</sup> and slide properties);

- format a slide (e.g. text alignment);

- configure the slideshow;

- and use the presentation (keyboard shortcuts).

It is important to be familiar with remark.js before you can understand the options in **xaringan**.

.footnote[[*] It is different with Pandoc's Markdown! It is limited but should be enough for presentation purposes. Come on... You do not need a slide for the Table of Contents! Well, the Markdown support in remark.js [may be improved](https://github.com/gnab/remark/issues/142) in the future.]

# Using xaringan

---

# xaringan

Provides an R Markdown output format `xaringan::moon_reader` as a wrapper for remark.js, and you can use it in the YAML metadata, e.g.

```yaml
---
title: "A Cool Presentation"
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    yolo: true
    nature:
      autoplay: 30000

# remark.js vs xaringan

Some differences between using remark.js (left) and using **xaringan** (right):

.pull-left[
1. Start with a boilerplate HTML file;

1. Plain Markdown;

1. Write JavaScript to autoplay slides;

1. Manually configure MathJax;

1. Highlight code with `*`;

1. Edit Markdown source and refresh browser to see updated slides;
]

.pull-right[
1. Start with an R Markdown document;

1. R Markdown (can embed R/other code chunks);

1. Provide an option `autoplay`;

1. MathJax just works;<sup>*</sup>

1. Highlight code with `{{}}`;

1. The RStudio addin "Infinite Moon Reader" automatically refreshes slides on changes;

.footnote[[*] Not really. See next page.]

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# R Code

```{r comment='#'}
# a boring regression
fit = lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)
coef(summary(fit))
dojutsu = c('地爆天星', '天照', '加具土命', '神威', '須佐能乎', '無限月読')
grep('天', dojutsu, value = TRUE)
```

---

# R Plots

```{r cars, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19, col = 'darkgray', las = 1)
abline(fit, lwd = 2)
```

---

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = 'html')
```

---

# HTML Widgets

I have not thoroughly tested HTML widgets against **xaringan**. Some may work well, and some may not. It is a little tricky.

Similarly, the Shiny mode (`runtime: shiny`) does not work. I might get these issues fixed in the future, but these are not of high priority to me. I never turn my presentation into a Shiny app. When I need to demonstrate more complicated examples, I just launch them separately. It is convenient to share slides with other people when they are plain HTML/JS applications.

See the next page for two HTML widgets.

```{r out.width='100%', fig.height=6, eval=require('leaflet')}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(-93.65, 42.0285, zoom = 17)
```

# Some Tips

- When you use the "Infinite Moon Reader" addin in RStudio, your R session will be blocked by default. You can click the red button on the right of the console to stop serving the slides, or use the _daemonized_ mode so that it does not block your R session. To do the latter, you can set the option

    ```r
    options(servr.daemon = TRUE)
    ```
    
    in your current R session, or in `~/.Rprofile` so that it is applied to all future R sessions. I do the latter by myself.
    
    To know more about the web server, see the [**servr**](https://github.com/yihui/servr) package.

--

- Do not forget to try the `yolo` option of `xaringan::moon_reader`.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        yolo: true
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- Slides can be automatically played if you set the `autoplay` option under `nature`, e.g. go to the next slide every 30 seconds in a lightning talk:

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          autoplay: 30000
    ```

--

- A countdown timer can be added to every page of the slides using the `countdown` option under `nature`, e.g. if you want to spend one minute on every page when you give the talk, you can set:

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          countdown: 60000
    ```

    Then you will see a timer counting down from `01:00`, to `00:59`, `00:58`, ... When the time is out, the timer will continue but the time turns red.
    
---

# Some Tips

- The title slide is created automatically by **xaringan**, but it is just another remark.js slide added before your other slides.

    The title slide is set to `class: center, middle, inverse, title-slide` by default. You can change the classes applied to the title slide with the `titleSlideClass` option of `nature` (`title-slide` is always applied).

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          titleSlideClass: [top, left, inverse]
    ```
    
--

- If you'd like to create your own title slide, disable **xaringan**'s title slide with the `seal = FALSE` option of `moon_reader`.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        seal: false
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- There are several ways to build incremental slides. See [this presentation](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/incremental.html) for examples.

- The option `highlightLines: true` of `nature` will highlight code lines that start with `*`, or are wrapped in `{{ }}`, or have trailing comments `#<<`;

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          highlightLines: true
    ```

    See examples on the next page.

---

# Some Tips


.pull-left[
An example using a leading `*`:

    ```r
    if (TRUE) {
    ** message("Very important!")
    }
    ```
Output:
```r
if (TRUE) {
* message("Very important!")
}
```

This is invalid R code, so it is a plain fenced code block that is not executed.
]

.pull-right[
An example using `{{}}`:

    `r ''````{r tidy=FALSE}
    if (TRUE) {
    *{{ message("Very important!") }}
    }
    ```
Output:
```{r tidy=FALSE}
if (TRUE) {
{{ message("Very important!") }}
}
```

It is valid R code so you can run it. Note that `{{}}` can wrap an R expression of multiple lines.
]

# Some Tips

An example of using the trailing comment `#<<` to highlight lines:

# Some Tips

When you enable line-highlighting, you can also use the chunk option `highlight.output` to highlight specific lines of the text output from a code chunk. For example, `highlight.output = TRUE` means highlighting all lines, and `highlight.output = c(1, 3)` means highlighting the first and third line.

````md
`r ''````{r, highlight.output=c(1, 3)}
head(iris)
```
````

```{r, highlight.output=c(1, 3), echo=FALSE}
head(iris)
```

Question: what does `highlight.output = c(TRUE, FALSE)` mean? (Hint: think about R's recycling of vectors)

# Some Tips

- To make slides work offline, you need to download a copy of remark.js in advance, because **xaringan** uses the online version by default (see the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader`).

- You can use `xaringan::summon_remark()` to download the latest or a specified version of remark.js. By default, it is downloaded to `libs/remark-latest.min.js`.

- Then change the `chakra` option in YAML to point to this file, e.g.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        chakra: libs/remark-latest.min.js
    ```

- If you used Google fonts in slides (the default theme uses _Yanone Kaffeesatz_, _Droid Serif_, and _Source Code Pro_), they won't work offline unless you download or install them locally. The Heroku app [google-webfonts-helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) can help you download fonts and generate the necessary CSS.

# Macros

- remark.js [allows users to define custom macros](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/80) (JS functions) that can be applied to Markdown text using the syntax `![:macroName arg1, arg2, ...]` or `![:macroName arg1, arg2, ...](this)`. For example, before remark.js initializes the slides, you can define a macro named `scale`:

    ```js
    remark.macros.scale = function (percentage) {
      var url = this;
      return '<img src="' + url + '" style="width: ' + percentage + '" />';
    };
    ```

    Then the Markdown text

    ```markdown
    ![:scale 50%](image.jpg)
    ```

    will be translated to
    
    ```html
    <img src="image.jpg" style="width: 50%" />
    ```

---

# Macros (continued)

- To insert macros in **xaringan** slides, you can use the option `beforeInit` under the option `nature`, e.g.,

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          beforeInit: "macros.js"
    ```

    You save your remark.js macros in the file `macros.js`.

- The `beforeInit` option can be used to insert arbitrary JS code before `remark.create()`. Inserting macros is just one of its possible applications.

# CSS

Among all options in `xaringan::moon_reader`, the most challenging but perhaps also the most rewarding one is `css`, because it allows you to customize the appearance of your slides using any CSS rules or hacks you know.

You can see the default CSS file [here](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/xaringan/resources/default.css). You can completely replace it with your own CSS files, or define new rules to override the default. See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for more information.

---

# CSS

For example, suppose you want to change the font for code from the default "Source Code Pro" to "Ubuntu Mono". You can create a CSS file named, say, `ubuntu-mono.css`:

```css
@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ubuntu+Mono:400,700,400italic);

.remark-code, .remark-inline-code { font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono'; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "ubuntu-mono.css"]
```

Here I assume `ubuntu-mono.css` is under the same directory as your Rmd.

See [yihui/xaringan#83](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/83) for an example of using the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font, which supports ligatures in program code.

# Themes

Don't want to learn CSS? Okay, you can use some user-contributed themes. A theme typically consists of two CSS files `foo.css` and `foo-fonts.css`, where `foo` is the theme name. Below are some existing themes:

```{r}
names(xaringan:::list_css())
```

---

# Themes

To use a theme, you can specify the `css` option as an array of CSS filenames (without the `.css` extensions), e.g.,

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: [default, metropolis, metropolis-fonts]
```

If you want to contribute a theme to **xaringan**, please read [this blog post](https://yihui.name/en/2017/10/xaringan-themes).

# Sharingan

The R package name **xaringan** was derived<sup>1</sup> from **Sharingan**, a dōjutsu in the Japanese anime _Naruto_ with two abilities:

- the "Eye of Insight"

- the "Eye of Hypnotism"

I think a presentation is basically a way to communicate insights to the audience, and a great presentation may even "hypnotize" the audience.<sup>2,3</sup>

.footnote[
[1] In Chinese, the pronounciation of _X_ is _Sh_ /ʃ/ (as in _shrimp_). Now you should have a better idea of how to pronounce my last name _Xie_.

[2] By comparison, bad presentations only put the audience to sleep.

[3] Personally I find that setting background images for slides is a killer feature of remark.js. It is an effective way to bring visual impact into your presentations.

# Naruto terminology

The **xaringan** package borrowed a few terms from Naruto, such as

- [Sharingan](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sharingan) (写輪眼; the package name)

- The [moon reader](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Moon_Reader) (月読; an attractive R Markdown output format)

- [Chakra](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Chakra) (查克拉; the path to the remark.js library, which is the power to drive the presentation)

- [Nature transformation](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Nature_Transformation) (性質変化; transform the chakra by setting different options)

- The [infinite moon reader](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Infinite_Tsukuyomi) (無限月読; start a local web server to continuously serve your slides)

- The [summoning technique](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Summoning_Technique) (download remark.js from the web)

You can click the links to know more about them if you want. The jutsu "Moon Reader" may seem a little evil, but that does not mean your slides are evil.

# Thanks!

Slides created via the R package [**xaringan**](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan).

The chakra comes from [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com), [**knitr**](http://yihui.name/knitr), and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).
